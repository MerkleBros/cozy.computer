### Background
I spent the second half of 2019 reading and analyzing over 200 short stories - mostly in the speculative fiction genre - with the goal of eventually writing and publishing my own stories.

I'll share here my thoughts on stories and as I go I'll try to point out interesting themes, motifs, language, organizational strategies that I enjoyed or thought I could learn from.

Feel free to read along with the story and share your own thoughts with me! I generally have a copy of every story that I write about and I'm happy to share it privately if it's not available on the internet.

Some goals:
- Share stories that were interesting to me
- Share some lessons learned
- Share some fun quotes
- Share some fun ideas

### About the story
This short story is one of many stories in the narcissistically named yet 1979 Pulitzer Prize winning collection [The Stories of John Cheever by John Cheever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stories_of_John_Cheever).

#### About the author
John Cheever is a Pulitzer prize winning author who must have written a lot of stories considering The Stories of John Cheever has 61 stories in it. Most of his stories, including his most popular ones, were published in The New Yorker ("The Enormous Radio", "Goodbye, My Brother", "The Swimmer", "The Five-Forty-Eight", "The Country Husband"). Cheever was an almost lifelong alcoholic and probably pretty gay despite the wife and kids - his daughter described the parent's marriage as "European", meaning staying together for the kids; Cheever's longest lover was a male student who literally lived in the house with the rest of his family.

##### Short synopsis (low spoilers):
The Westcott family listens to a lot classical music radio and so Jim Westcott decides to buy his wife Irene a new radio. It doesn't work quite as expected - instead of music it plays conversations from other people's apartments!

##### Fun vocabulary
> and in the cold weather she wore a coat of fitch skins dyed to resemble mink.

Fitch - the European pole cat or common ferret

> She turned the dial and got a satisfactory burst of Caucasian music-the thump of bare feet in the dust and the rattle of coin jewelry

Caucassian music meaning music from the Caucasus, see [Circassian music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_music) for instance.


##### Big idea: You can't unsee it
This story is about the end of Irene's naivety. In the opening paragraphs Irene is described as someone who has never had to worry (her forehead doesn't have wrinkle lines):

> Irene Westcott was a pleasant, rather plain girl with soft brown hair and a wide, fine forehead upon which nothing at all had been written...

As the story unfolds Irene becomes increasingly nervous and despondent.

[Weird Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_fiction) has a common theme that you could describe as "once you see it you can't unsee it". In that genre characters come face to face with some inexplicable event and become obsessed with understanding it. In this story Irene learns that her neighbors aren't the best humans - they sometimes argue, steal, gossip, etc. Once she's realized this she can't unrealize it. It begins to tear her up and she turns this realization inwards on herself and her own relationship.

##### Big idea: Public and private personas
The Westcotts discover that their neighbors are not the people they appear to be. Cheever likes to explore social facades - there's a lot of dinner parties and worrying about appearances in this story.

##### Big idea: Devil in the machine
It's a common trope - technology is bad, especially new untested technology. In this case the untested tech is a brand new radio that forces Irene to confront a difficult truth: that she and her neighbors are not perfect people.

One of my favorite stories about "bad technology" is from [Nature Magazine's Future series of short stories](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=futures):
- [What's Expected of Us by Ted Chiang](https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a)

##### Big idea: Horror story tropes
This story is definitely a horror story, although the climax is a confrontation with reality rather than with a ghost or monster or even the radio itself.

Some horror story elements:
- Romantic piano music interrupted with unexpected conversation
- Creepy wistful poetry from [Edward Lear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lear) ([The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo by Edward Lear](https://poets.org/poem/courtship-yonghy-bonghy-bo))
- The radio does some poltergeist stuff like get really loud for no reason, breaking unexpectedly, etc
- Eavesdropping on private intimate conversations about depression and derealization
- A constantly playing song ("Missouri Waltz")

##### Fun technique: Authority: Cultural Precedence
This story uses the familiar experience of listening to the radio as an entryway into the fantastic. The slow escalation from the mundane (listening to the radio) to the fantastic (spying on your neighbors through a radio) lends more authority and believability than if we had started with a fantastic radio that lets you spy on people.

Rather than starting with a magic radio, the story slowly escalates the couple's interactions with the radio (slight spoilers in list below):
- They like to listen to radio, so Jim buys Irene a new one
- The new radio is broken and makes weird noises
- The new radio is fixed
- The new radio lets them spy on other apartments but what they hear is funny
- The new radio lets them spy on other apartments but what they hear is sad
- The new radio lets them spy on other apartments but what they hear is awful

##### Fun technique: Texture: Lists
> The Westcotts overheard that evening a monologue on salmon fishing in Canada, a bridge game, running comments on home movies of what had apparently been a fortnight at Sea Island, and a bitter family quarrel about an overdraft at the bank. They turned off their radio at midnight and went to bed, weak with laughter.

Chuck Palahniuk describes texture as the way that time or narration flows in a story. The passage above uses the list technique to make time pass quickly by providing a parade of little images. Salmon fishing, bridge, home movies, a family argument - suddenly it's midnight.

##### Fun pitfall: The Fossil Assemblage
> A Salvation Army band was on the corner playing "Jesus Is Sweeter."

I don't know what "Jesus is Sweeter" is but maybe it's [something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU_YNIDbnzM)?

In his essay Frame of Reference, John McPhee describes the `fossil assemblage` - a collection of historical references that has not aged well. This story has a lot of cultural references in it, mostly to classical music. McPhee says that making direct references like this can be dangerous - a kind of loan that needs to be repaid (although usually this is meant for metaphors like "he had the face of Nicholas Cage"). If your audience doesn't understand your reference then it's just taking up space. And the dynamic nature of pop culture means that all references go stale eventually anyways.

##### Quotes
I think this is actually fairly common ghost story imagery and I wonder if it came from this story. An intimate piano melody is playing but is suddenly interrupted by someone speaking:

> She listened for a few minutes to a Chopin prelude and then was surprised to hear a man's voice break in. "For Christ's sake, Kathy," he said, "do you always have to play the piano when I get home?" The music stopped abruptly. "It's the only chance I have," a woman said. "I'm at the office all day." "So am I," the man said. He added something obscene about an upright piano, and slammed a door. The passionate and melancholy music began again.

A spooky nursery rhyme:
> " 'On the coast of Coromandel where the early pumpkins blow,' " a woman with a pronounced English accent said. " 'in the middle of the woods lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò. Two old chairs, and half a candle, one old jug without a handle…' "

It gets even spookier when it sounds far away:
> Jim turned the switch. First from a distance and then nearer, nearer, as if borne on the wind came the pure accents of the Sweeneys' nurse again: " 'Lady Jingly! Lady Jingly!' "she said, " 'sitting where the pumpkins blow, will you come and he my wife? said the Yonghy- Bonghy-Bò...' "

> The Westcotts overheard that evening a monologue on salmon fishing in Canada, a bridge game, running comments on home movies of what had apparently been a fortnight at Sea Island, and a bitter family quarrel about an overdraft at the bank. They turned off their radio at midnight and went to bed, weak with laughter.

> There was some faint coughing, a moan, and then a man spoke. "Are you all right, darling?" he asked. "Yes," a woman said wearily. "Yes, I'm all right, I guess," and then she added with great feeling, "But, you know, Charlie, I don't feel like myself any more. Sometimes there are about fifteen or twenty minutes in the week when I feel like myself I don't like to go to another doctor, because the doctor's bills are so awful already, but I just don't feel like myself, Charlie. I just never feel like myself" They were not young, Irene thought. She guessed from the timbre of their voices that they were middle-aged. The restrained melancholy of the dialogue and the draft from the bedroom window made her shiver, and she went back to bed.

> There were hundreds of clouds in the sky, as though the south wind had broken the winter into pieces and were blowing it north...

> They're really such nice people, aren't they?" she said. "They have such nice faces. Actually, they're so much nicer than a lot of the people we know."

Irene quotes her melancholy from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice
> " 'How far that little candle throws its beams,' " she exclaimed. " 'So shines a good deed in a naughty world.' "

> Our lives aren't sordid, are they, darling? Are they?"

> "Oh, I'm sick!" he shouted. "I'm sick to death of your apprehensiveness. The radio can't hear us. Nobody can hear us. And what if they can hear us? Who cares?"

The climactic scene involves Irene and Jim finally wiping away the 'perfect life' facade when Jim explodes. But Cheever drops the bomb a little too early by revealing that she's had an abortion in the middle of the paragraph:

> What's turned you overnight into a convent girl? You stole your mother's jewelry before they probated her will. You never gave your sister a cent of that money that was intended for her-not even when she needed it. You made Grace Howland's life miserable, and where was all your piety and your virtue when you went to that abortionist? I'll never forget how cool you were. You packed your bag and went off to have that child murdered as if you were going to Nassau. If you'd had any reasons, if you'd had any good reasons-"

Better IMO to put off that reveal as long as possible, something like below where you replace abortionist with something mundane, since it seems to me that "child murdered" is a lot stronger of a note to land on than "abortionist":

> and where was all your piety and your virtue when you went to (Rockland)? I'll never forget how cool you were. You packed your bag and went off to have that child murdered

#### Fin
That's all the thoughts for now. If you've read this story before or want a copy to read, let me know. I'd love to know what you think about it!
