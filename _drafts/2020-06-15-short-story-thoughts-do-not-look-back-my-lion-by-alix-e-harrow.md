### Background
I spent the second half of 2019 reading and analyzing over 200 short stories - mostly in the speculative fiction genre - with the goal of eventually writing and publishing my own stories.

I'll share here my thoughts on stories and as I go I'll try to point out interesting themes, motifs, language, organizational strategies that I enjoyed or thought I could learn from.

Feel free to read along with the story and share your own thoughts with me! I generally have a copy of every story that I write about and I'm happy to share it privately if it's not available on the internet.

Some goals:
- Share stories that were interesting to me
- Share some lessons learned
- Share some fun quotes
- Share some fun ideas

### About the story
Some content warnings for the story: blood, war/death (people and animals), slavery, pregnancy

This short story is a 2020 Hugo finalist published [here (Beneath Ceaseless Skies)](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/do-not-look-back-my-lion/).

#### About the author
Harrow has published just [a few short stories](https://alixeharrow.wixsite.com/author/short-fiction). Last year's Hugo/Nebula/Locus finalist story [A Witch’s Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies (Apex Magazine)](https://www.apex-magazine.com/a-witchs-guide-to-escape-a-practical-compendium-of-portal-fantasies/) is a fun read about a librarian witch who tries to find the perfect book for an increasingly at risk teenager.

#### The section without much spoilers

##### Short synopsis (low spoilers):
Eefa is a "crippled" healer in a warrior society that values strong women. Her wife Talaan is the most powerful warrior in the kingdom and together they have several strong daughters and one son. Eefa grows tired of their toxically masculine war state and must decide whether to abandon her family in search of something different.

##### Fun vocabulary
> `one sweet, sloe-eyed son.`

Sloe-eyed - having attractive, dark, typically almond shaped eyes

> packed with madder and salt to make it stain

Madder plant roots are used to make red dye.

##### Fun technique: Mix first, second, and third person point of views.
> She’s been a good healer, too, and delivered each of her wife’s four children: three great, howling daughters who latched like wolf pups to the breast and one sweet, sloe-eyed son... Soon they will be marching to war alongside their mother and Eefa will be praying and weeping and waiting for them, too.

> The hell I will. She squares her shoulders into the wind and keeps walking...

The first few paragraphs are a third-person knowledge dump about Eefa and her society.

Harrow uses a sudden switch to first-person to introduce immediacy and emotion. It breaks up the knowledge dumping by launching us back into the story. Using first person also pollutes the narrative: we now know that all of the third person sections are seen through Eefa's eyes.

The first person "I" is only used three times during the story, once to break into action and then twice as internal reflection that breaks away from the action.

The first person "my" is also used three times through the story, as "my love", "my daughter", "my lion", each use during an emotional reflection that breaks from the action.

Perspective switches are a useful way to switch between action and reflection.

##### Fun technique: World building: Replace modern titles
> Eefa is running from the city of Xot, from the Emperor and her ceaseless war-making, from her own sacred duties as a healer and a husband, from her near-daughters and near-son.

If you want to make a world seem more fantastical you can replace modern titles with something less familiar. Harrow has replaced `step-daughter, step-son` with `near-daughter, near-son`.

##### Fun technique: Title reference
Referring to the story's title is an easy way to heighten emotion or tie parts of the story together.

Throughout the story Harrow draws on the title indirectly by describing Eefa's wife with lion-like traits. Talaan - whose name evokes claw - is golden, with scarred cheeks like a lion's whiskers:

> She knows if she looks back she’ll see Talaan, her great golden wife, cheeks rough with numberless glory-scars, eyes like struck flint.

There are many other instances, like:

> Talaan has always reveled in her anger, like a cat rubbing too close to the fire

A "title drop" - where the narrator literally says the name of the title - can be used to create an emotional peak. It's a heavy-handed technique so you usually only see the exact title quoted once where it can be used to maximum effect.

This story - titled "Do Not Look Back, My Lion" - uses the phrase "look back" five times, one of them during the story's climax, although she never directly quotes the title:

- `Eefa does not stop. It is important not to look back.`
- `Eefa presses her palm against the door and thinks do not look back do not look back.`
- `She does not look back.`
- `Make it count, my Lion. Do not look back. (climax)`

##### Fun technique: Social models through repetition
> Even as a girl, Eefa looked like her god. In the murals in the Temple of Life Idral is a slight, demure woman with downward-sweeping lashes that lie like feathers on her smooth cheeks. She’s the softer sister, the weak sister, often painted with a newborn in her arms and delicate dove wings curled between her shoulder blades. Her temple is mostly empty these days.

The story builds up a world mostly through repeated emphasis on the two castes - healers and warriors. Almost no other aspects of the culture are touched upon besides this. Again and again the society is shown to have lost interest in the healers - this repeated emphasis helps us sympathize with Eefa because she is a healer.

The city has two temples, one for Idral the healer god and one for Ukhel the warrior god. Because Eefa and Talaan are a famous warrior/healer couple, they are directly compared to the two gods:

> Sometimes city-folk mutter and pray when Eefa and Talaan pass by: “The Twins have come to Xot, eh!” or “Death and Life walking among us!”

Repeated emphasis on a social model - and especially a character's restrictions in that structure - is an easy way to have readers identify with a character and understand that character's place in the world. A social model that the reader can place themselves in seems critical for writing an engaging fantasy setting.

##### Fun technique: Texture: The Montage
> By Talaan’s fourth month the baby is the size of a clenched fist, Eefa knows, and there are rumors that the eastern conquest is going poorly.

> By Talaan’s fifth month the baby is the size of a yam, and a ragged line of soldiers has straggled back through the city gates. Eefa works

> In Talaan’s sixth month, when the baby is the size of a curled cat, the Emperor visits their home.

> Labor comes early, when the moons are bright silver coins in the sky.

After the opening scene, the passage of time is measured in Talaan's pregnancy. This use of sudden visual changes is an effective way to make months pass in a few sentences. Chuck Palahniuk in "Consider This" describes "Textures" as a way to control the flow of information in your stories and gives "The Montage" as one type of "Texture".

Talaan's growing pregnancy marks a series of events in a tragic war.

##### Fun technique: Template sentences
> Six days later, Talaan goes to war.

> Six hours later, Talaan had proposed.

> Eefa has been a good husband, she knows, but now she is running.

> Eefa has been a good husband, but now she is running again.

You can place similarly structured sentences far enough apart that the reader has forgotten the first one but will still be subtly reminded of the structure. This creates a sneaky circular nostalgia.

#### The section with spoilers

##### Fun technique: Texture: Lists
> Eefa knows she is a small woman with a small destiny; she knows the war will go on without her. She knows women will still slaughter one another in the name of the gods and glory, men and children will still be collared and chained and branded with the Eye of Ukhel, funeral pyres will still burn oily and hot and the ash will still taste of iron and fat on their tongues. The Emperor will still sleep soundly at night knowing her people loved her, because once they have slaughtered for her they must keep loving her or be lost.

Lists act as a sort of visual parade. You can list off related things to force the reader to read word-by-word. The result can be a slowing down, in this case to notice the atrocities of the Emperor's warrior state. The list can also be used similar to The Montage, as if the viewer is seeing a series of comic-book panels:

> She sees Talaan walking alone through the dawn-pink streets, her still-soft belly wrapped in leather and copper, her sword bare and shining in her scarred hand. She sees the shadow of the palace stretch out to meet her, sees the wolf of war herself step out to meet her. Sees the fate of the empire hang in the frost-sparked air between their two blades.

##### Fun quotes
Just dumping some quotes that I enjoyed:

> Eefa has been a good husband, she knows, but now she is running.

> She’s been a good healer, too, and delivered each of her wife’s four children: three great, howling daughters who latched like wolf pups to the breast and one sweet, sloe-eyed son. All of them healthy and strong, all of them given their bloody promise-scars at birth. Soon

> She knows if she looks back she’ll see Talaan, her great golden wife, cheeks rough with numberless glory-scars, eyes like struck flint. She knows her stomach will flutter and swoop as it always does when she looks at her, a girlish thrill in loving something so fiercely dangerous, so radiant.

> Tuvo was supposed to have been her last child, almost sixteen years ago. But there had been a long siege and Talaan had been lonely, and one of those pretty little camp followers had caught her eye, and here they are.

> Even as a girl, Eefa looked like her god. In the murals in the Temple of Life Idral is a slight, demure woman with downward-sweeping lashes that lie like feathers on her smooth cheeks. She’s the softer sister, the weak sister, often painted with a newborn in her arms and delicate dove wings curled between her shoulder blades. Her temple is mostly empty these days.

> Ukhel’s temple, meanwhile, is flooded with worshippers. The floor is gummed with the blood of hens and calves and the air is heavy with char. Ukhel herself stands above them all, terrible and magnificent: one-eyed and one-breasted, a vulture hulking on her shoulder and her pregnant belly armored in red leather.

> Death-blessed, they called her when she was a girl, and they loved her.

> Sometimes city-folk mutter and pray when Eefa and Talaan pass by: “The Twins have come to Xot, eh!” or “Death and Life walking among us!” Thus is their endless war made holy, their victory assured...

> Winter is settling its white wings over the plains, and the easterners are clever savages with stone walls around each city and stores of millet and milk-wine. Xot’s armies grow weak and stupid with hunger.

> She knows by Talaan’s stiffness that she is awake, too. How many women and men have you slaughtered, my love? How many killers have I saved? She prays to Idral until dawn, a soft chanting that rolls and crashes in her mind, and imagines the daughter growing in Talaan’s belly: shining, innocent, unbloodied.

> Eefa knows she is a small woman with a small destiny; she knows the war will go on without her. She knows women will still slaughter one another in the name of the gods and glory, men and children will still be collared and chained and branded with the Eye of Ukhel, funeral pyres will still burn oily and hot and the ash will still taste of iron and fat on their tongues. The Emperor will still sleep soundly at night knowing her people loved her, because once they have slaughtered for her they must keep loving her or be lost.

> Nothing would change, really. War would persist, a great white wolf stalking through the city, fed by ten thousand eager hands. But not by mine.

>  The Emperor herself blesses each of them as they go through the city gates, cutting her own tongue and marking each soldier with a bloody kiss.

> Talaan returns. She is bloodied and limping, with great black bruises blooming like thunderclouds across her shoulder and something gray and deathly cold hanging in her eyes, but she returns. Tuvo does not.

> When he was a boy (he was still a boy when he died, choking on blood, his ribs crushed into his lungs by some barbarian’s hammer blow) he liked to rescue things. Sickly pups or abandoned rabbit kits, birds with crooked wings and open, panting beaks. He would bring them to Eefa to heal, and she would dribble warm mare’s milk into their mouths and think: this world was not made for boys like you.

> Labor comes early, when the moons are bright silver coins in the sky.

> She sees Talaan walking alone through the dawn-pink streets, her still-soft belly wrapped in leather and copper, her sword bare and shining in her scarred hand. She sees the shadow of the palace stretch out to meet her, sees the wolf of war herself step out to meet her. Sees the fate of the empire hang in the frost-sparked air between their two blades.

> All of it, all that golden, brimming life, she has given to Ukhel, to war. Now she will give her Death to something else. To life.

> Make it count, my Lion. Do not look back.

> By the second morning they are in the high pass over the mountains, and they can smell smoke. It isn’t the oily reek of a funeral pyre or the gentle stink of dung burning in the hearth, but something hotter and grander: the smoke of a burning city. It drifts in ashy clouds overhead and settles into their clothes and hair. There is something bright and clean about it, like the first snow; Eefa licks it from her lips.
