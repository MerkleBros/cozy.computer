### Why analyze short fiction?
I spent the second half of 2019 reading and analyzing over 200 short stories - mostly in the speculative fiction genre - with the goal of eventually writing and publishing my own stories.

I'll share here my thoughts on stories and as I go I'll try to point out interesting themes, motifs, language, and organizational strategies that I thought I could learn from. If the stories belong to an overarching genre I'll briefly touch on that genre. I'll also share what I didn't like as I believe this is an important part in developing a personal taste for writing.

Feel free to read along with the story and share your own thoughts with me! I generally have a copy of every story that I write about and I'm happy to share it privately.

Some goals:
- Share stories that were interesting to me
- Share some lessons learned
- Share some fun quotes
- Share some fun ideas

### Notes on Weird Fiction

#### What is the weird fiction genre?
The Town of Cats by Hagiwara Sakutaro is collected in the anthology [The New Weird by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2009/06/28/the-new-weird-anthology-notes-and-introduction/) as an example of [weird ficton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_fiction).

`Weird fiction` is a genre that takes elements from traditional supernatural Gothic tales without including the traditional tropes - tropes like vampires, ghosts, mummies, spooky castles, etc. By abandoning tropes the authors are free to come up with their own monsters (or implications of monsters).

`Weird fiction` is about the limitations of human understanding. From Ann and Jeff VanderMeer:

> (weird fiction) represents the pursuit of some indefinable and perhaps maddeningly unreachable understanding of the world beyond the mundane – a ‘certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread’ or ‘malign and particular suspension or defeat of…fixed laws of Nature’

`Weird fiction` acknowledges the failure to understand as a fundamental human limitation. Characters in `weird fiction` often cross the interface at the edge of human knowledge and become obsessed with that encounter. Once they've seen something that defies their model of the world, the characters in `weird fiction` are changed and forced to confront (or run from) their new reality.

`Weird fiction` is largely an urban genre. Its authors take scenes from everyday modern life but then weird stuff happens. Many weird tales use this modern setting to reflect on modern society as a sort of subtle morality tale.

To learn more about weird fiction I recommend reading the introduction (and the cleverly named "Foreweird" by Michael Moorcock) to The New Weird by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer.

Some `weird fiction` authors and stories that I've enjoyed that are represented in The New Weird by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer (I have not read all of the collection, I think most of the stories are nice):
- "The Night Wire" by H. F. Arnold
- "The Dunwich Horror" by H. P. Lovecraft
- "The Town of Cats" by Hagiwara Sakutar
- "The Aleph" by Jorge Luis Borges
- "The Summer People" by Shirley Jackson
- "The Howling Man" by Charles Beaumont
- "The Dark" by Karen Joy Fowler
- "The Ice Man" by Haruki Murakami
- "A Redress for Andromeda" by Caitlin R. Kiernan
- "The Specialist's Hat" by Kelly Link
- "Details" by China Miéville
- "The Town Manager" by Thomas Ligotti

#### Why do I like weird fiction?
I like `weird fiction` because it feels timeless. Because authors in this genre are free to make up their own weirdness, each story has a unique fingerprint. A weird story is not "a ghost story" or a "vampire story". It's not "high fantasy" or "science fiction". `Weird` stories to me feel either separate from genre or else genre twisting; each story seems to stand on its own so that these stories can only be grouped by a common otherness.

`Weird fiction` affects many of the same feelings as traditional genre horror - a sort of spooky frisson. In my mind, every weird fiction story has the same sort of dark and foggy atmosphere that you would associate with Gothic horror. I am personally drawn to this mysterious foggy aesthetic.

`Weird fiction` is set in modern times. Because the setting is so familiar to us, writing weird stories allows for a neat trick where you can twist this familiarity.

I also like that `weird fiction` can be fantastical without having to explicitly define rules in the story's universe. I often think of fantasy or urban fantasy as having a magic system that is well defined for plot purposes. But `weird` stories are about characters struggling to deal with the unexplainable. The systems in these stories seem unknowable and all the more mystical because of this. This is a convenient tool for the writer in that you need not explicitly explain the rules.

I suspect that going "full weird" - embracing your story's strangeness and otherness - is an example of [writing to your obsessions as described here by Kelly Link](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-weirdest-story-ideas-come-from-your-own-obsessions-5565717). I have an ongoing list of my own obsessions and encourage you to start one too!

### Story analysis
#### The section without much spoilers
Title: The Town of Cats
Author: [Hagiwara Sakutaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakutar%C5%8D_Hagiwara)
Words: 5267
Published in 1935
Translated into English by Jeffrey Angles

This story is collected in the anthology [The New Weird by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer](https://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2009/06/28/the-new-weird-anthology-notes-and-introduction/). It is exemplary of the `weird` genre because it plays with familiar and unfamiliar and shows how easily the two can be interchanged.

Short mostly-not-spoilers synopsis:
The main character likes to go on walks around his town although he does not pay much attention to where he is walking because he is a daydreamer. Often when he comes to he realizes he is in a different part of town than he thought. He seems quite lost until he sees a familiar building and suddenly his mental model of the town snaps into place and he knows exactly where he is - and indeed he has been there hundreds of times before.

##### Big ideas: Jamais vu
The story is about the moment before you realize where you are, when you are lost in a place that you've been to many times before. This happens to me often in New York City. I'll think I'm walking down a block I've never walked down before, until I see a familiar restaurant or cafe, and suddenly I am reoriented. It's like getting on the subway in the wrong direction. At first you think you're going north. But when the next stop comes you suddenly and violently realize your mistake. Like a flipping switch, your mental model is suddenly put on its head.

Hagiwara describes the feeling as suddenly having his internal compass spun around.

Hagiwara implies that the state between being lost and reorienting is a state entirely unto itself - one not based in reality, but only in one's corrupted mental model. In this way, if you are lost while walking around in a familiar neighborhood, then you've temporarily created a new neighborhood, one that cannot exist without your having made the mistake of thinking it exists. This imaginary neighborhood is fragile. It will cease to be real as soon as you find your bearings.

The Town of Cats explores the concept of `jamais vu`.

Where `déjà vu` is the feeling that the unfamiliar is familiar (I have not been in this place before but it feels like I have), `jamais vu` is the feeling that the familiar is unfamiliar (I have been here many times but it feels like I have never been here before).

##### Fun quotes
> The quality that incites the desire for travel has gradually disappeared from my fantasies.

Many narrators in `weird fiction` find their worldview shifted after encountering the weird.

> My family insisted a fox must have bewitched me.

The phrase `bewitched by a fox` was used in Japan to describe a misfortune. Foxes have a strong spiritual significance in Japan where they have lived in close human contact for a long time. They are seen as paranormal beings that possess abilities proportional to their age and wisdom. They can have nine tails. They can transform into people and play tricks. But they can also be faithful lovers and friends. Foxes were often seen as witch animals during the Edo period (1603-1867).

> Until a moment before, the crowds on my left had been on the right, and I discovered that, though I had been walking north, I was now headed south. In that instant when my memory returned to normal, the needle of my compass spun around, and the cardinal directions switched positions. The whole universe changed, and the mood of the town that manifested itself before me became utterly different. The mysterious neighborhood that I had seen a moment before existed in some universe of opposite space where the compass was reversed.

I liked the imagery of the spinning compass.

> When I was a boy a long time ago, and I used to examine a framed picture that hung on the walls of the house. I wondered all the while what worlds lay hidden on the reverse side of the framed landscape. I removed the frame repeatedly to peep at the back side of the painting. Those childhood thoughts have now turned into a riddle that remains impossible for me to solve even as an adult.

And the image of the boy inspecting the backs of picture frames.
