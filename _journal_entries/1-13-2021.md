[Marie's Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mariescrisiscafegroup/) is a Facebook group for [Marie's Crisis Cafe](https://nymag.com/listings/bar/maries-crisis-cafe/) where on weeknights they live-stream a pianist singing show-tune song requests, I listen to these a lot.

[Familiar's](https://www.familiarsbk.com/) is a cool east Bed-Stuy vegan coffee shop with yummy vegan bagel sandwiches. I like the Fancy Fig.

You can enjoy the sandwich in nearby [Saratoga Park](https://www.brownstoner.com/brooklyn-life/walkabout-brooklyns-small-parks-saratoga-park/), I often walk the mile over to read in this park. It's full of really beautiful, gnarled, old-growth trees and I love the way the setting sun casts shadows on their branches in the winter. Some history:

"When the city of Brooklyn was looking around for land to acquire for a park in the 25th Ward, this was one of the choices they had. In fact, according to the Parks Department Annual Report, in 1895, it was the only choice they had, being the only available piece of land in the district.

The center of the park holds a statue erected after World War I, commemorating the neighborhood people who died in the war. The sculptor, J. S. Novelli, designed a bronze [statue](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?pb=!1s0x89c25dc68ff83b7b%3A0xd9508bd59215e2c3!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPJahBU0cVdQ7g8D-iV5CP2AmfH7oHFiuwcsJKA%3Dw365-h274-k-no!5ssaratoga%20park%20sculpture%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCgIgAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipPJahBU0cVdQ7g8D-iV5CP2AmfH7oHFiuwcsJKA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwja7LusnZruAhVCMVkFHZzgBVYQoiowE3oECCIQAw) depicting Columbia, the symbol of liberty, holding a shield and a frond of victory."

[The School of Life by Alain de Botton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43264830-the-school-of-life) on playful teasing:

```
It is gratifying to be warmly teased because it is a sign that the
teaser has bothered to study a struggle within ourselves and
perceptively taken the side of the under-represented party.
```

The School of Life on Good Listeners:

```
They see vagueness as a universal and highly significant trouble of
the mind that it is the task of a true friend to help with.
```

The School of Life on Rage:
```
We arenâ€™t overwhelmed by anger whenever we are frustrated; only when we
first believed ourselves entitled to a particular satisfaction and then
did not receive it.
```
