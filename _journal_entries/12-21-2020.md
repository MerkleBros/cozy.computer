[The Black Candle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B08PYPDM3C/ref=msx_wn_pv?autoplay=1) is a documentary exploring Kwanzaa and the African-American experience.
- Kwanzaa is a progressive, postmodern holiday created in 1966 as an escape from traditional holidays which are necessarily rooted in existing cultures and don't apply to displaced peoples. Kwanzaa has seven principles that all emphasize community, collectivism, and mutual aid.

The Winter Solstice is today - it seems to signify the `start` of winter even though every day after the winter solstice gets longer! The coldest part of the year is actually a month later than the winter solstice because the Earth's mass takes so long to cool down. This is also why the hottest part of the day is in the afternoon instead of at noon.
- Some RC friends and I propose we come up with some in-between seasons to describe the transition between seasons: `Smush Spring, Simmer Summer, Weather Autumn, Slumber Winter`

[Natural Blend Vegan Cafe and Juice Bar](https://www.instagram.com/naturalblend/?hl=en) has some of my favorite vegan sandwiches in Bed-Stuy, love the curry chicken sandwich.

[Chez Alex](https://chezalexbrooklyn.com/) in Bed-Stuy has some really good vegan baked goods (I got a double chocolate cookie).

The Regrettes is a cool band, listened to their album Feel Your Feelings Fool! today on Spotify. My favorite songs are Hot, A Living Human Girl, Juicebox Baby, Pale Skin, Ladylike / Whatta BITCH
