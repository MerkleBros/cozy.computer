### Rest weary traveler - and dry your socks.
Cozy computer is CC to me

Spindled in comfort and beeping softly

Cozy computer with cuppa coffee

Or mocha, or Hi-C, or even Capri



```
Cozy computer (CC) whispers squeaky
Look upon my works ye mighty, and drink tea
Nothing beside remains
```
#### My works
- [a work](work.md)
